## 1️⃣ What Is Git Rebase

**Rebase** moves your commits and **replays them on top of another branch**.

Instead of merging histories, Git:
- Temporarily removes your commits
- Updates your branch to latest base
- Re-applies your commits one by one

---

## 2️⃣ Rebase vs Merge (Conceptual Difference)

<img width="259" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f980b32-281b-4b54-9287-2231a7828551" />

| Merge | Rebase |
|-----|-------|
| Preserves history | Rewrites history |
| Adds merge commit | No merge commit |
| Safe for shared branches | Dangerous if misused |
| Non-linear graph | Linear history |

> **Merge records what happened. Rebase pretends it happened later.**

---

## 3️⃣ When Rebasing Is Used

✔ Clean feature branch before PR  
✔ Keep linear commit history  
✔ Update feature branch with latest `main`  
❌ Never rebase shared / pushed branches  

---

## 4️⃣ Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

**Explanation:**
- Creates `feature-branch`
- Switches to it immediately
- Base is current `main`

---

## 5️⃣ Make Commits on Feature Branch

```bash
echo "Feature commit 1" >> feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Feature commit 1"
```

```bash
echo "Feature commit 2" >> feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Feature commit 2"
```

**Explanation:**
- Two commits exist only on `feature-branch`
- `main` remains unchanged

---

## 6️⃣ Advance Main Independently

```bash
git checkout main
```

```bash
echo "Main commit 1" >> main.txt
git add main.txt
git commit -m "Main commit 1"
```

**Explanation:**
- `main` now has new commits
- Branch histories diverge

---

## 7️⃣ Trigger the Rebase

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

**Explanation:**
- Git finds the common ancestor
- Temporarily removes feature commits
- Replays them on top of latest `main`
- **Commit hashes change**

---

## 8️⃣ What Happens During Rebase (Internals)

Internally Git does:

```
1. Save feature commits
2. Move branch pointer to main
3. Re-apply commits one by one
4. Create NEW commits
```

Old commits become **orphaned**.

---

## 9️⃣ Visual Diagram – Before Rebase

```
main (HEAD)
*
| Main commit 1
*
| Initial commit
 \
  feature-branch
  *
  | Feature commit 2
  *
  | Feature commit 1
```

---

## 🔟 Visual Diagram – After Rebase (History Rewritten)

```
main
*
| Main commit 1
*
| Initial commit
 \
  feature-branch (HEAD)
  *
  | Feature commit 2'
  *
  | Feature commit 1'
```

⚠️ Apostrophe (`'`) means **new commit hash**

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Real Rebase Conflict Scenario

Conflict occurs when:
- Same file
- Same lines
- Modified in both branches

Example:
```bash
git rebase main
```

❌ Conflict in `feature.txt`

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Resolving a Rebase Conflict

Open the conflicted file:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Main branch change
=======
Feature branch change
>>>>>>> Feature commit
```

### Resolve manually:

```text
Main branch change
Feature branch change
```

Then continue:

```bash
git add feature.txt
git rebase --continue
```

Repeat until all commits are replayed.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Abort a Rebase

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

**Explanation:**
- Cancels the entire rebase
- Restores branch to original state
- No history damage

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Common Mistakes

❌ Rebasing pushed branches  
❌ Rebasing `main` or `develop`  
❌ Force-pushing without team agreement  
❌ Using rebase to “fix” broken commits  

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Best Practices & Final Mental Model

### Best Practices
✔ Rebase only local feature branches  
✔ Rebase before PR, not after  
✔ Use merge for shared branches  
✔ Use interactive rebase for cleanup  

### Final Mental Model

> **Rebase rewrites time. Merge records reality.  
> Use rebase for clarity, merge for collaboration.**

---

## 🧠 One-Line Summary

> **Rebase makes history cleaner, but mistakes permanent — respect it.**
